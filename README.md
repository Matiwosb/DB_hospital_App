# DB_hospital_App

To execute the program you need to have Python and any IDE installed. To run the program write python appilcation_interface.py in the terminal or command line and it should run and show the command line interface of the application.

# Bug
When we ran the application, we had errors and it was not running in the right way. The problem was when connecting to the interface it lost the database connection. When testing each file they work separately, they stop working when they are connected.

Before executing the program the hospital.db file needed to be deleted for proper execution.
